    Thread started when a first client connects to the web socket.

    - Need a while loop to receive status continuously from Alarm Process 
    - Only one thread needed whatever how many web clients. 
    - Commands could be received directly from web server socketio handlers but it is cleaner to centralize all inter-process comminication here, commands and status (moreover, this thread is initialized with an instance of flask socketio allowing to communicate easily with the web app).
